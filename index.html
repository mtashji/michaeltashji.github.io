  <h2> Creative Direction, Marketing & Communications </h2>

  <b>  MICHAEL TASHJI Â©2018 </b>

  <p> I am a multi-disciplined creative director living and working in New York City. I received a BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1993, where I focussed on graphic design, architecture, sculpture, and film. I moved to New York City in 1994 and worked for several agencies as a designer and art director. In 2000, I founded a boutique design firm serving colleges, museums, and the marketplace. My client, The City University of New York, asked that I come on board as their creative director in 2005. At CUNY, I led marketing and communications initiatives for the university and its colleges, centers, and institutes. I volunteer for many civic and non-profit institutions, and mentor through the NYC Board of Education.
